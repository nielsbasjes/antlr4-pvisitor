The maven release plugin turned out to be too hard to handle.
So we do it manually.

# Ensure all has been committed

# Ensure it all works
mvn clean verify -PpackageForRelease
mvn clean

ANTLR4VERSION=4.9.3

# Prepare the versions for the release. The 'NEXT' is because it is unknown if we just update the Antlr4 version or that we really change something.
RELEASEVERSION=1.0-${ANTLR4VERSION}
NEXTVERSION=1.0-${ANTLR4VERSION}-NEXT

# Creating and publishing the new Tagging
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${RELEASEVERSION}

git status
git commit -m"Version ${RELEASEVERSION}" -a

# We must first tag it because the tag is generated into the code
git tag -a v${RELEASEVERSION} -m"Tag Version ${RELEASEVERSION}"

#mvn clean deploy -Prelease -Pdeploy-local
#VERIFY If this all looks good

# These two profiles are defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml
mvn clean deploy -PpackageForRelease -Prelease -Pdeploy-sonatype

# Now check SONATYPE

mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${NEXTVERSION}-SNAPSHOT

# Update ReleaseProcedure.txt (versions near the top)

git commit -m"Start development for ${NEXTVERSION}" -a

git push
git push origin v${RELEASEVERSION}
