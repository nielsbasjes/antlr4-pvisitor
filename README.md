# A Parameterized Visitor for ANTLR4 
I have the usecase where I need to pass a parameter along with my visitor.

What I'm trying to do is have a tree stucture with 'patterns' and while walking recursively through 
the parse tree using the visitor match my parse result against the 'pattern tree'.

This parameter is therefor the node in the other tree.

There has been discussion about such a wish before

https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/641

What this project does is simply change only the files that need to be changed and change the code generation accordingly.

# This project
I simply copy a smal number of Java files (including the Java.stg).

In my application I use the Java.stg to generate different application code and 
use this as a dependency to override the official Antlr4 classes.

# Current status
Untested!

Seems to work on my machine, it will most likely melt yours.

# LICENSE
This project is essentially a relatively simple (but not backward compatible!) change of the existing Antlr 4.7.2 code.

These files are simply some of the original Antlr4 files with a generic added here and there.
So this >99% a 1-on-1 copy of the Antlr4 code.
